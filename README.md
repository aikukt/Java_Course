01.
Type sysout then pres Ctrl + space, then enter to get a faster System.out.println(); 
You can also use this for other commands to get the coding faster.

02.
Can't get { after a fresh install??
Go to Window > Preferences and type Keys in the search.
In the keys search type Ctrl + Alt + b, and click on "Unbind Command" then "Apply and close".
Now you can code on.
