1.	
Type sysout then pres Ctrl + space, then enter to get a faster System.out.println(); You can also use this for other commands to get the coding faster.

2.	
Can't get { after a fresh install?? Go to Window > Preferences and type Keys in the search. In the keys search type Ctrl + Alt + b, and click on "Unbind Command" then "Apply and close". Now you can code on.

If you need to comment on something you can use
